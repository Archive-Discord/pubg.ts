## ü¶Ñ Usage

### Sign for a developer account

You'll first need to [sign up on the PUBG developer API site](https://developer.playbattlegrounds.com/). Using this account you can create a API token

### Register an app

With an account created, you can [create a new developer application](https://developer.playbattlegrounds.com/apps/new?locale=en) that will provide you with your API key.

### Make something!

Here's a few small examples of what you can do with this library

```typescript
import { Client, Shard } from "pubg.ts";

const client = new Client({
  apiKey: "your_key_goes_here",
  shard: Shard.STEAM, // Optional (Default: Steam)
});

// Get a single or multiple player(s) using their name or ID
const player = await api.getPlayer({
  value: "single_name_or_id_or_array_of_such",
});

// Fetch a data from a single match
const match = await client.getMatch({
  id: "a036c694-be29-4dea-833d-b6ff84323de7",
});

// Get the current active season
const activeSeason = await client.getSeason();

// Get season stats for a specific player
const playerSeason = await client.getPlayerSeason({
  player: player.id,
  season: activeSeason,
  ranked: false, // Optionally gets stats for ranked gamemodes
});
```

Using individual fetchers

```typescript
import { Shard, getPlayer, getMatch, getSeason } from "pubg.ts";

// Get a single or multiple player(s) using their name or ID
const player = await getPlayer({
  apiKey: "your_key_goes_here",
  shard: Shard.STEAM, // Optional for all hooks (Default: Steam)
  value: "single_name_or_id_or_array_of_such",
});

// Fetch a data from a single match
const match = await getMatch({
  apiKey: "your_key_goes_here",
  id: "a036c694-be29-4dea-833d-b6ff84323de7",
});

// Get the current active season
const activeSeason = await getSeason({
  apiKey: "your_key_goes_here",
});

// Get season stats for a specific player
const playerSeason = await getPlayerSeason({
  apiKey: "your_key_goes_here",
  player: player.id,
  season: activeSeason,
  ranked: false, // Optionally gets stats for ranked gamemodes
});
```
